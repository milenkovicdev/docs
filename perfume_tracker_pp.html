    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <h2>Welcome to Perfume Tracker!</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is very important to us. In this privacy policy, we explain how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use our app. Please read this document carefully to understand our practices regarding your information.</p>

    <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
    <p>Perfume Tracker is an application developed by Stefan Milenkovic (referred to as "we" or "us"). Our app is designed to provide users with an easy and intuitive way to manage and track their perfume collections and does not require users to create an account or collect personal data.</p>

    <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>Our app does not collect personal data such as your name, email address, phone number, or any other identifiable information. We do not collect location data, device information, or any other data that could identify you.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Synchronization</h2>
    <p>Our app stores data locally on your device to provide you with the best user experience. If you choose to enable synchronization, your data will be synced to your personal iCloud account and stored in your private iCloud database. This synchronization is only performed if you give your consent through the device's settings.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Data generated by the app is stored on your device and is not sent to our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>iCloud Synchronization:</strong> If you allow it, your data will be synced to your iCloud account to enable access across your Apple devices. This process is fully controlled by you, and we do not have access to or control over your iCloud data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing with Third Parties</h2>
<p>Our app does not use any third-party services, and therefore, we do not collect or share any data with external parties. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your information remains secure.</p>
<p>However, please be aware that when you access our Privacy Policy or other external content hosted on third-party platforms, such as GitHub Pages, those platforms may collect data independently of us. We do not have control over or responsibility for the data collection practices of these third-party platforms. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party services or platforms you use or interact with to understand their data collection practices.</p>
<p>While we do not integrate or share data with third-party services, we recommend taking caution when clicking on any external links or using third-party websites that may collect information about you.</p>


    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>Although we do not collect your data, we strive to provide the highest level of security for the app. We use best practices to prevent unauthorized access or damage to the app and any locally stored data. Synchronization with iCloud is managed securely through Appleâ€™s encryption protocols.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or comments regarding this privacy policy, please feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:stefan.milenkovic.ios@gmail.com">stefan.milenkovic.ios@gmail.com</a></p>
